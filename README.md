# Cyclistic — Member X Casual Analysis

## BACKGROUND

About Cyclistic. A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.

Scenario. I am a junior data analyst in the marketing analysis team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in Chicago. Our marketing director believes that the future success of our company hinges on increasing the number of annual memberships. My task is to delve into how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. The insights from this analysis will be instrumental in formulating a new marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. However, before these plans can be put into action, they need to be approved by the Cyclistic executives. To ensure their approval, I need to back up my recommendations with solid data insights and present them through professional data visualizations.
